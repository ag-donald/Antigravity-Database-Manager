# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- **Missing database keys**: Script no longer dies fatally when `trajectorySummaries` key is missing from database — creates it from scratch instead
- **Silent write failures**: Replaced `UPDATE` statements with `INSERT OR REPLACE` for both Protobuf and JSON index writes, ensuring the script works on completely blank or corrupted databases
- **License reference**: Updated docstring from MIT to Unlicense to match `LICENCE.md`

### Added
- Multi-workspace limitation warning displayed during interactive workspace registration
